During my graduate degree, I'm working as a Teaching Assistant (TA) for a variety of undergraduate computer science courses at the University of Ottawa. This involves teaching weekly lab/tutorial sessions, holding weekly office hours, grading theory and programming assignments and proctoring midterms and final exams. Below is a list of courses I'm currently TA-ing and have previously TA-ed.

**Winter 2018 (Current)**:

_CSI2132 Database I_ 

The objectives for this course are:

- Learn fundamental database concepts including entity-relationship modeling, relational algebra and relational calculus, relational databases and functional dependencies and normalization.
- Understand how to create and manage databases using SQL.
- Design a web application that uses a database in a team project.

This course does not have a public website. A github link to the material I teach in this course can be found [here](https://github.com/rkhal101/CSI2132-Databases-I).

**Fall 2017**:

_CSI2110 Data Structures and Algorithms_

This is the second time I TA this course. The course website can be found [here](http://www.site.uottawa.ca/~lucia/courses/2110-17/).


**Winter 2017**:

_CSI2101 Discrete Structures_

The objectives for this course are:

- Learn advanced concepts in discrete mathematics and how to apply them to various types of problems in computing.
- Analyze algorithms, prove correctness of programs, model network problems with graphs and use number theory to solve cryptographic problems.
- Practice writing precise mathematical proofs.

The course website can be found [here](http://www.site.uottawa.ca/~lucia/courses/2101-17/).



**Fall 2016**: 

_CSI2110 Data Structures and Algorithms_

The objectives for this course are:

- Learn in a systematic way the most commonly used data structures with emphasis on their abstract properties.
- Understand the typical algorithms that operate on each kind of data structure and learn how to analyze their performance.
- Learn how to compare different data structures for solving the same problem, and choose the best data structure for the given problem.
