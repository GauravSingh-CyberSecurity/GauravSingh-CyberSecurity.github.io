I'm a student at the University of Ottawa studying Master of Computer Science with the Thesis Option under the supervision of <a href="http://www.site.uottawa.ca/~cadams/" target="_blank">Dr. Carlisle Adams</a>. My main focus of research is on open source web application vulnerability scanners, and my research interests include web application penetration testing and pretty much anything related to cryptography.
