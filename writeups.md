As a cybersecurity professional specializing in VAPT (Vulnerability Assessment and Penetration Testing), I document my security research, vulnerability findings, and penetration testing methodologies through detailed writeups.

This section includes:
- **Vulnerability Research**: Analysis of discovered vulnerabilities and their exploitation techniques
- **VAPT Reports**: Sanitized examples of professional vulnerability assessments
- **CTF Writeups**: Solutions to Capture The Flag challenges and security competitions
- **Security Tools**: Custom tools and scripts developed for penetration testing
- **Bug Bounty Findings**: Responsible disclosure reports and methodologies

My goal is to share knowledge with the cybersecurity community while continuously improving my skills through practical hands-on security testing and research.

You can also find my security research and findings on my <a href="https://github.com/singhggithub" target="_blank">GitHub profile</a>.
