<p>Hi everyone! This is my academic website. On here you can find information about my current research interests and projects I decide to embark on. I will be blogging regularly about material that I'm currently teaching, CTF challenges I'm completing and different research areas I delve into! Improvements, comments and constructive criticisms are welcome, so feel free to contact me!</p>
