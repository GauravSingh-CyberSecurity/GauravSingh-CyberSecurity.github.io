I have recently developed an interest in penetration testing and therefore I have decided to improve myself in this area by completing information security challenges available online and documenting the solutions to the problems in the form of writeups.

My first goal is to complete the <a href="http://overthewire.org/wargames/" target="_blank">OverTheWire Wargames</a> challenges which helps individuals interested in this area to learn and practice security concepts in the form of game challenges. You can view my completed writeups and monitor my progress <a href="/writeups/wargames/" target="_blank">here</a>.
