The easiest way to run the Web Input Vector Extractor Teasor ([WIVET](https://github.com/bedirhan/wivet)) is using the docker image created by [andresriancho](https://hub.docker.com/r/andresriancho/wivet/).

Prerequisite tasks: Install and run Docker.

Once you have Docker up and running, run the following command in the terminal to pull a wivet image from the registry andresriancho/wivet:

```*
docker pull andresriancho/wivet
```

To ensure that the image was pulled correctly on your server, run the following command:

```*
docker images 
```

What this command does is list all the Docker images that are currently on your server. When you run the "images" command you should see an output similar to the following:

```*
REPOSITORY            TAG                 IMAGE ID            CREATED             SIZE
andresriancho/wivet   latest              312f698542aa        2 years ago         482MB
``` 

Now, the last step is to run the Docker wivet container. This can be done using the "run" command:

```*
docker run -p 127.0.0.1:8080:80 andresriancho/wivet
```

In the command we specify the host to be "localhost" and the port number to be "8080". Now, you should be able to access wivet on your browser: [http://localhost:8080/](http://localhost:8080/).
